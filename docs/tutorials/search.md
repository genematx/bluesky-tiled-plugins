# Search

A catalog of Bluesky Runs can be searched (filtered) based on metadata. The
metadata is drawn from the Bluesky documents that are issued at the beginning
and end of each Run: the _Run Start_ and _Run Stop_ documents.

A dot `.` can be used to traverse nested fields.

```python
from tiled.queries import Key

catalog.search(Key("start.num_points") > 3)
catalog.search(Key("start.sample.element") == "Ni")
catalog.search(Key("stop.exit_status") == "success")
```

As a convenience, if the prefix `start.` or `stop.` is not specified, `start.`
will be searched by default.[^1]

```python
catalog.search(Key("num_points") > 3)  # "num_points" -> "start.num_points"
```

Queries can be chained to progressively narrow results:

```python
catalog.search(...).search(...).search(...)
```

Tiled provides [built-in search queries][] covering most common use cases:
equality, comparison, full text, and more.

The `bluesky_tiled_plugins.queries` module adds some additional queries specific
to querying catalog of Bluesky Runs.

- {py:func}`bluesky_tiled_plugins.queries.PartialUID`
- {py:func}`bluesky_tiled_plugins.queries.ScanID`
- {py:class}`bluesky_tiled_plugins.queries.ScanIDRange`
- {py:class}`bluesky_tiled_plugins.queries.TimeRange`

For backward-compatibility with common legacy workflows, item lookup on a
Catalog of Bluesky Runs integrates these queries:

- `catalog[<positive integer>]` searches by scan ID.
- `catalog[<partial uid>]` searches by partial UID.
