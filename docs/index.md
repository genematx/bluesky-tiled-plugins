## Overview

The **bluesky-tiled-plugins** repositories provides tools for using [Tiled][]
with [Bluesky][].

- A Bluesky callback for **saving metadata and data** from Bluesky documents in
  Tiled
- Custom Tiled **search queries** targeting Bluesky-specific metadata like
  `ScanID` and `TimeRange`
- Classes that **extend the Tiled Python client** to display Bluesky-specific
  metadata and provide Bluesky-specific convenience methods
- A Tiled exporter that **"replays" Bluesky documents** reconstructed saved data
  and metadata

Documentation is split into [four categories](https://diataxis.fr), also
accessible from links in the top bar.
