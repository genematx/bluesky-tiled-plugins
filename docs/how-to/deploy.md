# Deploy Tiled for Bluesky

## In process

For "first steps", tutorials, and "embedded" deployments, the
`SimpleTiledServer` is a good solution. It deploys Tiled on a background thread.

```python
from tiled.server import SimpleTiledServer

tiled_server = SimpleTiledServer()
tiled_client = from_uri(tiled_server.uri)
```

By default, it uses temporary storage. Pass a directory, e.g.
`SimpleTiledServer("my_data/")` to use persistent storage.

Additionally, if the server needs access to any detector-written files, pass
`SimpleTiledServer(readable_storage=["path/to/detector/data"])`

## Single-process

### Quickstart

Launch Tiled with temporary storage. Optionally set a deterministic API key (the
default is random each time you start the server).

And, as above, if the server needs access to any detector-written files, pass
`-r ...`.

```sh
tiled serve catalog --temp  [--api-key secret] [-r path/to/detector/data]
```

### Persistent storage

To save Bluesky data Tiled needs:

- a "catalog" database for metadata
- a "storage" database, which is will use to safely stream the data from the
  Event documents

Launch one like so:

```sh
tiled serve catalog --init ./catalog.db -w duckdb://./storage.db [--api-key secret] [-r path/to/detector/data]
```

If you may use this same Tiled instance to upload processed or analyzed data, it
is recommended to also provide tiled with a writable filesystem location,
`-w path/to/uploaded/data`.

To enable the streaming Websockets capability, additionally pass a Redis
connection string such as `--cache redis://localhost:6379` or
`--cache rediss://username:password@localhost:6380`.

## Scalable

For horizontally scaled deployments, PostgreSQL is currently recommended for
both the catalog and storage databases. (Use separate databases! But they can
share a PostgreSQL instance.)

At NSLS-II, we deploy Tiled horizontally scaled in 24 containers load balanced
behind HAproxy.
